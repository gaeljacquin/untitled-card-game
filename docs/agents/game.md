# Game Concepts

- "AB" prefix means "Arrange Better"
- Grid modes: `four` (4x4) and `five` (5x5)
- Core flow: client selects mode and initiates a game; server generates seed and deals initial hand; client places cards and discards one; server deals next hand until grid is filled; server evaluates poker hands across rows/columns.
