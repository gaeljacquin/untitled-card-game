## 🃏 About the Game

Untitled Card Game is a single-player card puzzle that combines the familiar scoring of poker with the strategic challenge of grid placement. Think of it as a blend of solitaire and sudoku, but with poker hands.

**What makes it special:**

- **Strategic Depth**: Every card placement matters. You're not just making one hand—you're building multiple hands simultaneously across rows and columns.

- **Two Game Modes**: Start with the 5×5 grid for a quick puzzle, or challenge yourself with the larger 6×6 grid for more complex decision-making.

- **No Time Pressure**: Take your time planning the perfect arrangement. This is a game about thinking, not rushing.

- **High Score Challenge**: Beat your personal best or compete with friends to see who can master the perfect grid.

**Perfect for:**
- Poker fans looking for a new twist on the classic game
- Puzzle enthusiasts who enjoy spatial reasoning challenges
- Anyone who wants a relaxing yet engaging game to play at their own pace

Whether you're a poker pro or just learning the hands, Untitled Card Game offers a fresh and satisfying puzzle experience that's easy to learn but difficult to master.
